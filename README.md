# Precision Closed-Loop AC Power Controller using PID Algorithm

**Course:** PH3144 Electronics-I with Lab

**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress ðŸš§

A project to design and build a closed-loop AC power controller using a PID algorithm to deliver a precise, stable power output to a load.

## Team Members & Responsibilities
* **Uday Pratap Bais (20231267):** Hardware Lead (Electrical), Design Lead.
* **Yash Dadhwal (20231287):** Software Lead (Algorithm), Testing, Software Integration.
* **Yojit Kumar (20231289):** Hardware Lead (Electronics), Documentation Lead.

## Project Structure
* **/docs:** Contains all project documentation, including the report, component datasheets, and images.
* **/hardware:** Contains hardware design files (schematics, PCB layouts from KiCad).
* **/src:** Contains all Arduino source code, organized by testing phase.
* **/dump:** Put anything and everything we find before the finalizing of the project, It may later get sorted and moved to the relavant folders.

## Getting Started
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yojit-kumar/PH3144_ElectronicsProject`
2.  Install the required Arduino libraries:
    * `EmonLib`
    * `LiquidCrystal_I2C`
